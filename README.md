# weather-dashboard
The project was to create a weather app and use the OpenWeather API (https://openweathermap.org/api) to retrieve weather data for cities.  Also to use localStorage to store any history of searches.

Using three different APIs from OpenWeather I was able to retrieve weather data including current weather, 5 day forecast, and the UV index of the current day. The UV index value includes a button color according to the UV value. 

This project was one of the hardest for me to do. There was many different way to code everything and I have a lot of difficulty with retrieving specific data in the API response.
